              <strong>a-sh</strong> is <EmMed>a small human</EmMed>, literally.
              Due to her not-so-tall physique, she may be shy at the first
              meeting. However, people say she is very approachable, friendly,
              and great to work with.

              design agencies. She loves branding, illustration, typography and
              can be a little bit nerdy with typesetting and file management.
              She is recognised as a dedicated team player who appreciates being
              challenged to adapt to various demands to improve mutual growth
              and success.
